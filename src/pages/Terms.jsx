          <p className="mb-2">
            The cost of the services depends on the size of your project,

            actual quote/proposal by providing us with the drawings/plans and

          <p className="mb-2">
            Payment must be made and verified before we can proceed with the
            work. Please note any payment received after 2 pm EST will be
            started the next day. If you are on a subscription membership plan,
            your account must have available credits to cover your order.

            Client Requirements:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            For prompt service and to meet due dates, clients must provide us
            with complete information such as drawings, specifications,
            addendum, and required reports which are the technical needs and
            requirements for the services of take-offs and estimating.

            Disclaimer on Take-off Results:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            While we strive to be 100% accurate and apply a 2-step quality
            control process on all take-off results, circumstances beyond our
            control such as scale discrepancies, missing specs, human errors, or
            incomplete sets of blueprints can affect overall accuracy.
            Therefore, we encourage all customers to thoroughly review all
            take-off results before using them for any bidding or purchase
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            We offer on-screen live reviews and unlimited revisions within 15
            days of the take-off delivery date to our clients on the same set of
            plans provided at the time of order. Should updated versions of the
            plans be submitted after delivery or during the take-off process,
            additional fees may apply. After 15 days, if no revisions or zoom
            call reviews are requested, the customer releases Bid Works
            Estimating of all claims related to the take-off results. Due to job
            conditions and area variables, your final requirements and material
            costs may vary.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Due Dates:</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            It is very important for us to meet the agreed due date. However,
            sometimes it is hard to determine how much time the order will
            actually take once we are working on it. If you have a specific date
            you must meet, please specify at the time of order, and we will
            advise asap if we can meet the deadline. We consistently provide
            updates; you can track your order in your dashboard, and you can
            also contact us anytime to find out the status of your order.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Please note any payment received after 2 pm EST will be started the
            next day. We do work on take-offs through the weekend; however, if
            your order delivery date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, then your
            order will be delivered on the next business day.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Refund Policy:</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            If you are not happy with the results of your take-off order, please
            contact us as we do offer unlimited revisions within 15 days of
            delivery and will work with you on a resolution of your concern. We
            do not offer refunds after work has been started. We pride ourselves
            on detailed accurate take-off work, but if by human error or type-o
            there was a mistake on your order, we will correct & revise it at no

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Revision Policy:</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            We base all take-offs and estimating on the date and version of the
            original drawings/plans submitted at the time of quoting. If there
            are any human errors or type-o on our part, we do offer free
            unlimited revisions to correct your take-off results within 15 days
            of delivery. We also note your files with any requested changes so
            that your next order will include your preferences.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            If the original drawings/plans have been revised and the client
            needs a new take-off based on new drawings, we can complete this new
            take-off request at a discount, but please note there will be an
            additional cost. Should updated versions of the plans be submitted
            after delivery or during the take-off process, additional fees may
            apply.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">
            Assumption Policy:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            We offer professional quantity take-off services based on the plans
            provided. We don’t prefer to work on assumptions as we do not do
            value engineering. The information in your results will be based
            solely on the plans and specs provided at the time of service.
            However, we may make some assumptions where needed at our
            discretion, but we will note the take-off if this is the case.

            Cost Estimating Policy and Explanation:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Options 1:</strong> Labor/Man Hours Count (No Rate) (Level 1
            or 2) unless this rate is provided by the customer or on the
            plans/specs.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>Options 2:</strong> Using RS Means or Craftsman General
            Average Price cost estimating (Labor & Materials) per item.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Prices are based on average material and labor prices in the USA,
            pin local zip code, or the country where the project is located. You
            will be able to edit those prices, and all the formulas will be
            changed accordingly in the Excel sheet. We mostly use costing
            software; however, some items that are not found on costing software
            are sometimes needed to complete a cost estimate. To supplement, we
            may do research and use websites like Home Wyse, Home Depot, other
            construction websites, and gathered experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            *Labor Hours are not included in this price of cost estimating
            unless added as an option.*
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <strong>*IMPORTANT*</strong> This is only an average cost. Please
            check your cost estimating results before using the information due
            to the current market fluctuation in the cost of construction
            materials at this time.

            Disclaimer on Cost Estimating Results:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Cost estimating is an average price ONLY using costing software. It
            will NOT include your specific overhead, equipment cost, or custom
            item pricing, etc. We DO NOT call manufacturers to verify prices
            until you take our procurement services. Please review the pricing
            before using our information. It is meant to be a guide of the
            average cost in the area of the job site, but your pricing may
            differ depending on your company’s specific overhead, profit
            margins, requirements, or consumables. If you have a price list that
            you would like us to use, we can make changes to your cost
            estimating results, or please note that your Excel worksheet is
            editable, so you can also make adjustments per your company pricing
            and requirements. The average costing explanation is also located on
            your estimate and invoice too. Due to the market conditions of
            changing construction prices in the USA, we remind you that this is
            a national average price only. Please be sure to check this
            information before you use it. You can email us at{" "}
